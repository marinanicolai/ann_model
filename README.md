# 📊 ANN Model Explorer by Marina

This project demonstrates how to build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow and Streamlit to predict customer churn based on a bank's dataset.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Churn Modeling Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivan118/churn-modeling-dataset/data)

## 🚀 Deployment

- **Framework:** Deployed using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- **Demo:** Accessible via [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nicolai-ai/ann-model-demo)
